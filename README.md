### Getting Started

> If you're only developing for one platform you can ignore the steps below that are tagged with the platform you don't require.

### 1) Clone & Install Dependencies
- 1.1) git clone https://github.com/VladCojanu/Siply.git
- 1.2) cd Siply
- 1.3) Install NPM packages `yarn`
- 1.4) [iOS] cd ios and run pod install
- 1.5) [Android] No additional steps for android here.
  
#### 2) Start the app
- 2.1) Start the react native packager, run `yarn run start` from the root of the project.
- 2.2) **[iOS]** Build and run the iOS app, run `yarn run ios` from the root of the project. The first build will take some time. This will automatically start up a simulator also for you on a successful build if one wasn't already started.
- 2.3) **[Android]** If you haven't already got an android device attached/emulator running then you'll need to get one running (make sure the emulator is with Google Play / APIs). When ready run `yarn run android` from the root of the project.
